# Dice Roller

Rolls dice. A fancier and more fun hello-world. Enter dice like in tabletop RPGs.

This is just a fun, trivial project for me to do over and over in different languages, different styles, and with different tools. Its not about finding the best way to solve this problem, but more about practicing solving the same problem in many different ways to learn their pros and cons.

## Completed Versions:
* Rust
* C
* Python
* Tcl/Tk
* Crystal

### WIP Versions:
* Haskell
* Go
* Clojure
* ReactJS

### TODO Versions:
* Ruby
* Nim
* Java
* Kotlin
* Smalltalk
* Perl
* Common Lisp
* Swift
* C++
* PHP
* Android

### Concepts
* TDD
* Functional
There's probably a bunch of other concepts/styles/patterns I could explore. Iterators/Generators for the die object, maybe even an MVC, logging/history, something else I havent heard of. Could do GUI stuff too.

### Crazy versions:
* Game Boy
* ARM asm
* x86 asm
* C++/Qt GUI
